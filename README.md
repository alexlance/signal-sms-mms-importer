# SMS and MMS import into Signal Messenger

Turns out it's basically impossible to import your old MMS messages into Signal.

This little script takes an XML file - as generated by SMS Backup and Restore (Synctech),
and uses https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools to dissect a normal
Signal backup file, and re-construct it again with all the messages from the
XML file imported.

Only tested on Android!


1. Generate a Signal backup file

```
Signal -> Chats -> Backups -> Local Backup
```

2. Transfer that file to your computer, file will be named eg: signal-2022-06-10-17-00-00.backup

3. Run signalback-tools over the Signal backup file, eg:

```
  # Install signalbackup-tools
  git clone https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools ... (follow their directions for installation)

  # signal 30 digit backup passphrase
  key=123451234512345123451234512345

  # create a dir to store the dissected Signal backup
  mkdir output

  # use signalbackup-tools to dissect the Signal backup
  ./signalbackup-tools ./signal-2022-06-10-17-00-00.backup ${key} --output output/

```

4. Generate an SMS Backup and Restore (SyncTech) XML file on your phone and transfer that to a computer.

5. Run the script in this repo over the XML file:

```
python3 sms-mms-import-to-signal.py sms-20220611130220.xml output/
```

6. Use signalbackup-tools to wrap up the new Signal backup file:

```
# note: file suffix of signal backup files *must* be ".backup"
signalbackup-tools output/ --output ./signal.backup --opassword ${key}
```

7. Transfer signal.backup to your phone

8. Delete Signal from your phone

9. Reinstall Signal, it'll ask you if you've got a backup file that you want to restore from. You
will need:

a) The 30 digit passcode
b) A phone number that you can receive their validation code on
c) The Signal PIN number that you may have setup

10. Open Signal, you should see all your text message and MMS messages in Signal now.
